      <>
        This project was developed for the Genius Arena Talent Land 2023 on the
        Capgemini Car-To-Share track. Our goal was to develop and embeded system
        and a mobile app that enabled the user to rent, reserve, open and drive
        a shared car. <br />
        We developed an embedded system based on the ESP32 microcontroller that
        could be installed in most comercial cars and a cross platform mobile
        app to control it.
